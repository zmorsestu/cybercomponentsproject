  <h1>SMART Doorbell Project</h1>
  <h2>Daniela Gonzalez, Bryanna Parkoff, and Zachary Morse</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>SUMMARY:</h3>
  <p>With physical security being a main concern nowadays and the cost of surveillance technology being expensive, our team, Cyber Operations, would like to propose the development of a SMART Ring doorbell using a raspberry pi 4. This is no ordinary SMART Ring doorbell. Besides sending an email of the entity who is ringing your doorbell and other surroundings around your home to your phone, it will provide the footage to a Cloud-Based Server. Furthermore, our IOT device will be connected to AWS IOT Core, a service AWS Cloud provides to securely transmit the footage and alert notifications in and out with low latency and high throughput.
    To sum up, we believe that monitoring our device in this manner is a better practice than just taking the input from the IOT Device standing alone. Since AWS IOT Core can collect and analyze device data it would be able to provide you with solutions when the device is in bad health. These benefits will drive greater business value, deliver real-time, actionable insights, accelerate decision making and create value for your customers in a breeze.
